# Accessibility Report

This report aims to provide self-evaluation on the accessibility of this program.

## Equitable Use

This is a stand-alone game, which means no requirement on connection to the internet after installation. This enhances the safety and security of the program. The open-source nature of this program makes it available to everyone.

## Flexibility in Use

It features with a symmetric GUI design. It comes with relatively large GUI buttons for operations.

## Simple and Intuitive Use

It is a relatively simple program, so with only a few options at each time an operation is required, the user should 
feel intuitive to use. Information and buttoms are naturally merged together so feedback should be
notified with no effort.

## Perceptible Information

There are generally two types of information: description of situation and 
options for the next step. The description of situation is always centered and is to be
read first.

## Tolerance for Error

The in-game progress is always saved using serialization. With limited options, the
user probably never goes wrong with the program with exception being caught.

## Low Physical Effort

This program does not require a lot of user input. And the program in general is static in terms of GUI.

## Size and Space for Approach and Use

The program still needs to work on varying text font and size, and the buttom may be scalable to accommodate smaller
screens.

## The Target Market

For the players who love to have Pokemons in a retro style. This game should naturally reminds people 
the era of 2G network where online games are mostly text-based.

## To Certain Demographics

This game may no be appealing to the ones used to graphics-based games nowadays. However, since it has its text-based
nature, people who do read braille can easily make use of it through some light modification to the program.
