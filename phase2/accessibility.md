# Accessibility Report

This report aims to provide self-evaluation on the accessibility of this program.

## Equitable Use

- This is a stand-alone game, which means no requirement on connection to the internet after installation. This enhances
  the safety and security of the program.
- The open-source nature of this program makes it available to everyone.
- Something to be further improved is that we can separate the text to be displayed so that this program can support
  multi-language.

## Flexibility in Use

- It features with a mostly symmetric GUI design, which means both right-handed and left-handed users are not negatively
  affected.
- It comes with relatively large GUI buttons for operations.
- The main body of the GUI is resizable to fit in most of the screens.

## Simple and Intuitive Use

- It is a program that is relatively simple to use, so with several options at each time an operation is required, the
  user should feel intuitive to use.
- Information and buttons are naturally merged together so feedback should be notified with no effort.
- Something to be further implemented is an instructive tutorial about how to play.

## Perceptible Information

- There are generally two types of information: description of situation and options for the next step.
- The description of situation is always centered and is to be read first.
- The displayed text always describe the situation in a legible way.

## Tolerance for Error

- The in-game progress is always saved using serialization.
- With limited options, the user probably never goes wrong with the program with exception being caught.
- Something to be implemented is that the program should tell the users what has been saved every time the in-game
  progress is serialized and saved.

## Low Physical Effort

- This program does not require a lot of user input.
- The program in general is static in terms of GUI, which does not need persistent attention.
- Something to be implemented and improved is that the user may be tired of "refreshing" on maps for the relatively rare
  pokemon, so that such process may not need confirmation if nothing exciting comes up repeatedly.

## Size and Space for Approach and Use

- The program still needs to work on varying text font and size, more specifically, the buttom may be scalable to
- accommodate smaller screens.
- The GUI is designed in a way such that various types of input devices are accommodated well.
- Night mode can be added.

## The Target Market

For the players who love to have pokemon in a retro style. This game should naturally remind people the era of 2G
network where online games are mostly text-based. This game currently lacks of graphical contents for the vivid images
which are usually associated with pokemon. This game may also be appealing to the little ones who are starting to read
and are also interested in the story of pokemon.

## To Certain Demographics

This game may not be appealing to the ones used to graphics-based games nowadays. However, since it has its text-based
nature, people who do read braille can easily make use of it through some light modification to the program. On the
other hands, people who have difficulty reading a lot of text may find the game tedious to play. Also, it is easy to see
that nowadays the majority of PC gamers are more interested in games that come with vivid graphical contents.
